<h3>Overview</h3>
<dl>
	<dt>Use Cases
		<dd>Use cases are implemented in POJO classes, usualy as void methods with no parameters.
		<br>These methods are marked with a <i>MetaTask</i> annotation which indicates icons, tool tips etc.
		<br>The class is then 'registered' with the TaskManager.
		<br>Use cases can then be executed via the TaskManager using an 'action-key' of the 
		form <i>SimpleClassName@methodName</i>
		<br>Menues and buttons can be created and added to a display simply by refering to the action-key. 
		<br>TaskManager can enable/disable tasks (use-cases). 
		<br>Buttons will be enabled/disabled in line with the TaskManager enable/disable.
		<br>The actions can be executed in-line or as separate threads / delayed / AWT thread etc. 
	
	<dt>Icons
		<dd><i>GuiIconManager</i> provides the functionality to retrieve Icons by name,
		but also allows for compositing/overlaying of icons.
		<br>The Icon set typically comprises of main icons (eg Document, Script ...) 
		<br>and 'modifier' icons (+ for add, - for remove, etc) which can be overlayed. 
		<br>The MetaTask annotation can refer to an icon with a text expression.
		<br>eg: 'document+remove' will create a new icon starting with document.png
		and then overlaying any non-transparent areas from remove.png.
		<br>The resulting icon is then cached against it's reference 'document+remove'.
		<br>User application can also get an icon from the manager by specifying a key/text-expression.
		
		<dt>Data Access
		<dd>Data objects are also implemented as POJO classes.
		<i>MetaFieldInfo</i> annotations are use to provide additional information about the data fields.
		<br>Default screens for editing these objects (or fields) can be auto-generated.
		<br><i>GuiConfigScreen</i> can create an edit screen for any simple data object.
	
	
	<dt>xml
		<dd>Provides simplified XML support to parse, create and query xml structures.
		
		<dt>util
		<dd>Various utilities, including functionality to persist and reload data objects 
		as xml documents. (makes use of xml package)
