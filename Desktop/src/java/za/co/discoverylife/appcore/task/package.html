Supports execution of actions / use cases etc as Runnable actions.
<p>
In this GUI framework application all actions such as menu selections 
and button presses are handled by kicking off a Runnable action.
These actions can be run in-line, or spawned as separate threads or even 
assigned to be executed as part of the AWT thread.
<p>
All classes that provide use-cases etc should be registered with the
TaskManager (static class). The TaskManager provided mechanisms
to look up and envoke the registered actions and use case.
<p>
In general, to add one or more use-cases the user needs to create a simple class
with methods for each use case. The methods should be void and not take any
parameters. The methods should be annotated with MetaTask items.
